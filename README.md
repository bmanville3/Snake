# About the Game
This program is the classic Snake game you can find on Google or any other site. There are four game modes: Snake, Speed Snake, Crazy Apples Snake, and Random Maze Snake (maze generation disucssed at the end). Snake is the classic game mode you are used to. Speed Snake is just 3x as fast as Snake. Crazy Apples Snake spawns apples every 3 blocks moved and get progressively faster the longer you stay alive (note not based on your size). Random Maze Snake is less of a snake game and more of just solving a random maze (more later). These game modes can be toggled in the GUI by simply clicking the buttons. 

A player can move using W, S, A, D or UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. A player can pause using SPACE. Once a player dies by touching the border or themselves, they can press space to restart. The game will keep track of the highest session score for each game mode. The game also has a leader board and a username system. Players can sign in and keep track of their all time highs. Simply compile and run the file to play or download the .jar file (requires at least JRE installed). Once the game is started, press any direction to play.

# Goal of this Project and the Implementation Choices
The goal of this project was to create a functioning GUI and practice my OOP skills. I thought making a game would be a fun way to do both of these. I chose Java as my language since I recently did a project in Python and another in MySQL and had not done one in Java.
To make the GUI, I used JavaFX. The playing field itself is a GridPane of Rectangles that change colors. I used AnimationTimer in JavaFX to move the game forward and implemented a KeyListener to take commands from the player.

The OOP part comes in with the backing structure of the game. I am sure the visual and backing structures could easily be combined into one for the first three games, but I chose to make them separate. This was, I have direct access to a lot of moving parts, have more of the code written by me directly, and can also tamper with the game mechanics without visually showing it which is important for Random Maze Snake. Within my implementation, I have some private classes (Block, Board, Snake, and User) and the main public class, SnakeGame. The Blocks make up a board and have a specific type: EMPTY, APPLE, SNAKE. These types can be found in the enum blockType. The Snake class represents the snake and the blocks it takes up on the board via a LinkedList. The Board itself is a main part of the backing structure for the game and where the action takes place. The User class is the where the leaderboard and scores are kept.

I chose to make all classes private for three reasons: 1) I wanted to have direct access to everything. I did not want to have to call getters and setters for such a small project. Also, the private classes only interact directly with the backing mechanics of the game itself 2) most of the classes are small (except the User class) 3) I wanted to have all the code in one spot. I did not want to have to sort through many files.

# Random Maze Snake Play and Implementation
Random Maze Snake is quite different from the other three game modes in play and in code. The game always starts the player in the top left corner of the board. The player must navigate a randomly generated maze to get to find the apple on the right side (where the specific location is changed each game). This has a catch: the player can only see one square away in any direction. Therefore, they must almost blindly traverse the maze to find the apple. Once the apple in found, the maze is fully revealed and players are free to roam the maze or press SPACE to start a new maze.

There are some coding highlights from Random Maze Snake I want to cover. This game mode no longer has a JavaFX AnimatoinTimer, so the player does not constantly move. Instead, movement is purely done by player input. The program will try to generate a random maze by placing random walls across the map; it turns 1/3 of the total blocks to walls. Of course, this could lead to unsolvable mazes, so I have implemented a maze solver. This solver uses a stack based Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the maze and terminates when the apple is found or the stack is empty. If the apple is not found, a new random maze is generated. This is done a maximum of 200 times. As of now if there are somehow 200 mazes generated with no solution (which is HIGHLY unlikely), an error message pops up in the GUI saying a maze could not be generated and instructs the user to try to restart the game. I would like to add a default maze to use in this case in the future, but I do not think it is super important since at least half the games generated are solvable (from a little testing).

# Leaderboard
The leaderboard is a recent implementation. It has a private class User that backs it. It allows for users to select an account to user, add new accounts, or delete old accounts. This allows for users to keep track of their highscores. There is also a leaderboard of the highest scores from each type of game. I chose to keep track of everything in Highscore.txt that is formatted like a .csv file. The .jar file has this text file compiled with it.

The leaderboard is still in the bug fixing phase. Most of the features are worked out, but there is always the occasional bug that pops up. The only way to find these bugs is through playing the game, so if you find any, please let me know so I can fix them! I am trying to play the game myself to find the bugs, but with the semester coming back, I may not have time to thoroughly test all possibilities. I believe all game-breaking bugs are gone though.

This was just a quick overview of the code. Hope you enjoy the game!
