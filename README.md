# About the Game
This program is the classic Snake game you can find on Google or any other site. There are three game modes: Snake, Speed Snake, Crazy Apples Snake. Snake is the classic game mode you are used to. Speed Snake is just 3x as fast as Snake. Crazy Apples Snake spawns apples every 3 blocks moved and get progressively faster the longer you stay alive (note not based on your size). These game modes can be toggled in the GUI by simply clicking the buttons. A player can move using W, S, A, D or UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. A player can pause using SPACE. Once a player dies by touching the border or themselves, they can press space to restart. The game will keep track of the highest session score for each game mode. Simply compile and run the file to play or download the .jar file (requires at least JRE installed). Once the game is started, press any direction to play.

# Goal of this Project and the Implementation Choices
The goal of this project was to create a functioning GUI and practice my OOP skills. I thought making a game would be a fun way to do both of these. I chose Java as my language since I recently did a project in Python and another in MySQL and had not done one in Java.
To make the GUI, I used JavaFX. The playing field itself is a GridPane of Rectangles that change colors. I used AnimationTimer in JavaFX to move the game forward and implemented a KeyListener to take commands from the player.

The OOP part comes in with the backing structure of the game. I am sure the visual and backing structures could easily be combined into one, but I chose to make them separate. This was, I have direct access to a lot of moving parts, have more of the code written by me directly, and can also tamper with the game mechanics without visually showing it. Within my implementation, I have some private classes (Block, Board, and Snake) and the main public class, SnakeGame. The Blocks make up a board and have a specific type: EMPTY, APPLE, SNAKE. These types can be found in the enum blockType. The Snake class represents the snake and the blocks it takes up on the board via a LinkedList. The Board itself is a main part of the backing structure for the game and where the action takes place.

This was just a quick and dirty overview of the code. Hope you enjoy the game!
